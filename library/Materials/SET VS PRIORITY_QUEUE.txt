std::priority_queue allows to do the following:
	Insert an element O(log n)
	Get the smallest element O(1)
	Erase the smallest element O(log n)

while std::set has more possibilities:
	Insert any element O(log n) and the constant is greater than in std::priority_queue
	Find any element O(log n)
	Find an element, >= than the one your are looking for O(log n) (lower_bound)
	Erase any element O(log n)
	Erase any element by its iterator O(1)
	Move to previous/next element in sorted order O(1)
	Get the smallest element O(1)
	Get the largest element O(1)
